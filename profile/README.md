We also do a lot of Open Source. We are proud to give back to the community as
we use a lot of Open Source tools ourselves. Our main project is a collection
of starters named 🚀 Start UI:

- [🚀 Start UI [web]](https://github.com/BearStudio/start-ui-web) our principal
  project, based on NextJS, using TypeScript, Chakra UI, React-Query and other
  cool technologies.

- [🚀 Start UI [native]](https://github.com/BearStudio/start-ui-native) the same
  project, but using React Native and related technologies.

- [🚀 Start UI [figma]](https://github.com/BearStudio/start-ui-figma) the base
  for the UI of the two previous projects.

- [🚀 Start UI [colors]](https://github.com/BearStudio/start-ui-colors) a work
  in progress project that will be a plugin for Figma.
